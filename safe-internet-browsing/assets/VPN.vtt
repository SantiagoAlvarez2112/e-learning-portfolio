00:00:00.075 --> 00:00:02.015
Introducing VPN technology

00:00:03.375 --> 00:00:09.460
So...What is a VPN?
VPN stands for Virtual PRivate Network.
It’s technology

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:13.128
that encrypts your data when you use the Internet, scrambling it so that

00:00:13.278 --> 00:00:15.485
strangers on the same network can’t read it.

00:00:16.642 --> 00:00:21.705
But....How does it work?
Imagine you want to send a letter. Normally, you’d

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:25.107
put the letter in an envelope and mail it. 
But you don’t want anyone

00:00:25.257 --> 00:00:30.436
else to read it on the way....so what to do?
With a VPN, it’s like sending

00:00:30.586 --> 00:00:33.803
your letter through a special, locked tunnel that only you and the person

00:00:33.953 --> 00:00:37.855
receiving it can open. 
That way, no one else can peek inside.

00:00:39.075 --> 00:00:43.279
When should you use a VPN?
When connecting to public Wi-Fi networks like

00:00:43.429 --> 00:00:48.782
cafes.......public parks.......or airports.
When accesing sensitive information

00:00:48.932 --> 00:00:53.832
such as banking......or work accounts.
To bypass geographic restrictions

00:00:53.982 --> 00:00:56.061
and access content safely.

00:00:57.209 --> 00:01:01.192
While a VPN can increase your security, there are a few considerations you

00:01:01.342 --> 00:01:05.267
should know.
They do not protect you against malware or viruses on your

00:01:05.417 --> 00:01:09.981
device.
They cannot guarantee complete anonymity online.
They cannot

00:01:10.131 --> 00:01:14.857
prevent phishing attacks or unsafe downloads.
...Even with a VPN you

00:01:15.007 --> 00:01:17.539
still need to have good cybersecurity habits

00:01:18.942 --> 00:01:22.914
Know that you know what a VPN is and how it works....
Consider using a

00:01:23.064 --> 00:01:28.231
VPN to safeguard your privacy, especially on public networks....
Choose

00:01:28.381 --> 00:01:32.666
a trusted provider....
Stay informed about online risks...
And combine

00:01:32.816 --> 00:01:37.356
VPN use with strong security practices for the best protection....
Thanks

00:01:37.506 --> 00:01:41.513
for going throught this minicourse on VPN...remeber to use it wisely and

00:01:41.663 --> 00:01:45.216
stay safe whenever you're online.
You may now continue.
